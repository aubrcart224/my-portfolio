# Tetris AI: Reinforcement Learning Project

This project implements an AI agent that learns to play Tetris through reinforcement learning techniques. The agent progressively improves its gameplay by learning from its experiences.

## Project Motivation

Tetris presents an interesting challenge for AI systems because it requires both strategic planning and quick decision-making. I wanted to explore how reinforcement learning approaches could be applied to this classic game problem.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **PyTorch**: Used for building and training neural networks
- **OpenAI Gym**: Custom environment created for Tetris gameplay
- **Pygame**: Used for visualization and rendering

## Implementation Details

The reinforcement learning agent uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture consisting of:

1. A feature extraction component that analyzes the current game state
2. Multiple fully connected layers that process these features
3. An output layer that predicts the value of each possible action

```python
class DQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(DQN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)
```

## Training Process

The training process involved the following steps:

1. **Exploration Phase**: The agent initially takes random actions to explore the environment
2. **Experience Collection**: Storing game states, actions, rewards, and next states in a replay buffer
3. **Learning**: Periodically sampling from this buffer to update the neural network
4. **Policy Improvement**: Gradually shifting from exploration to exploitation as training progresses

## Results

After approximately 1,000,000 training steps, the agent achieved impressive results:

- Average Score: 5,200 points
- Maximum Lines Cleared: 280
- Consistent ability to reach level 15+

The graph below shows the learning progress over time:

## Demo Video

A video demonstration of the trained agent playing Tetris at high speed is available on my YouTube channel.

## Future Improvements

There are several areas I plan to explore to enhance this project:

1. Implementing alternative algorithms like PPO or A3C for comparison
2. Optimizing the state representation for better feature extraction
3. Adding human gameplay data to provide demonstrations for imitation learning
4. Creating an interactive web interface where users can challenge the AI
