# Kernel Driver Project

This project involved developing a custom Linux kernel driver to interface with specialized hardware for a real-time data processing system.

## Project Overview

The kernel driver was designed to provide low-latency access to hardware resources while maintaining system stability and security. It was developed for Linux kernel 5.10 LTS and is compatible with both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures.

## Key Features

- Direct memory access (DMA) implementation for high-speed data transfer
- Interrupt handling for real-time event processing
- Custom ioctl interface for user-space applications
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Challenges

One of the most significant challenges was implementing proper memory management to prevent memory leaks or corruption in kernel space. This required careful attention to kernel memory allocation APIs and proper cleanup procedures.

```c
static int device_mmap(struct file *filp, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
    struct my_device_data *data = filp->private_data;
    unsigned long size = vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start;

    /* Ensure size doesn't exceed our buffer */
    if (size > data->buffer_size)
        return -EINVAL;

    /* Map the buffer to user space */
    return remap_pfn_range(vma, vma->vm_start,
                          virt_to_phys(data->buffer) >> PAGE_SHIFT,
                          size, vma->vm_page_prot);
}
```

## Performance Optimization

The driver was carefully optimized to minimize latency and maximize throughput. This involved:

1. Reducing memory copies between kernel and user space
2. Implementing efficient locking mechanisms
3. Optimizing interrupt handling

## Testing & Validation

The driver was thoroughly tested using both automated test suites and manual testing procedures. Performance benchmarks showed that our implementation achieved a 40% reduction in latency compared to the previous approach.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the importance of understanding both hardware and software interactions at a deep level. The resulting driver is now used in production environments where low-latency data processing is critical.
